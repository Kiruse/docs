title: "Apophis - Keplr Signer"
description: "A signer integration for Keplr & Leap."
---

This package exposes the `KeplrSigner`, and a derived class `LeapSigner`. `KeplrSigner` is a
specialization of the `Signer` class from `@apophis-sdk/core` designed to make it easier to
integrate new [Keplr](https://keplr.app) forks (such as [Leap](https://leapwallet.io)).

## Usage

```ts
import { Signer } from "@apophis-sdk/core";
import { KeplrSigner, LeapSigner } from "@apophis-sdk/keplr-signer";

Signer.register(
  new KeplrSigner(),
  new LeapSigner(),
);
```

## Deriving from KeplrSigner
