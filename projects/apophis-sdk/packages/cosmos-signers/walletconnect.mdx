The `@apophis-sdk/walletconnect-signer` package implements a signer that uses WalletConnect to
connect to a mobile wallet. It is currently only supported on mobile devices.

## Usage
The WalletConnect signer differs rather dramatically from the other signers due to the asynchronous
dual-device nature of WalletConnect. If you use the complementary [Cosmos Components](/projects/cosmos-components)
package, it already handles WalletConnect for you, and you merely need to call `Signer.register`.
But if you intend to build your own connection modal, there are some things to consider:

```ts
import { signals } from "@apophis-sdk/core";
import { WalletConnectCosmosSigner } from "@apophis-sdk/walletconnect-signer";

const signer = new WalletConnectCosmosSigner({
  projectId: '...',
});

// Begins the WalletConnect flow.
signer.connect().then(() => {
  signals.signer.value = signer;
});

signer.state.subscribe(state => {
  switch (state.state) {
    case 'pending':
      hideSpinner();
      // The signer is still waiting for the second device to connect & approve.
      if (!state.uri) {
        console.warn('The URI should always be present if your WalletConnect project is properly configured.');
        return;
      }
      showQRCode(state.uri);
      break;
    case 'connected':
      hideSpinner();
      // The connection may have been restored from a previous session. This flag tells you if it was.
      // The Cosmos Components' Wallet Modal uses this to prevent immediately re-connecting if the
      // modal was opened with a previously connected WalletConnect session.
      if (state.restored) {
        // ...
      }
      break;
    case 'error':
      hideSpinner();
      showErrorToast(state.error);
      break;
    case undefined:
      // Initializing
      showSpinner();
      break;
  }
});
```

Note that the above code is a simplified example, with functions like `showQRCode` and `showErrorToast`
that must be defined by you.
