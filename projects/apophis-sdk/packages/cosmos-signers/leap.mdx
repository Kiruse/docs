description: "A signer integration for Leap Wallet."
---

[Leap](https://leapwallet.io/) is a fork of [Keplr](https://keplr.app/) that is compatible with the
Keplr API. Thus, the `LeapSigner` is contained within the same `@apophis-sdk/keplr-signer` package.

## Usage

```ts
import { Signer } from "@apophis-sdk/core";
import { KeplrSigner, LeapSigner } from "@apophis-sdk/keplr-signer";

Signer.register(
  new KeplrSigner(),
  new LeapSigner(),
);
```

For more information see the [Keplr Signer](/projects/apophis-sdk/packages/cosmos-signers/keplr)
page.
