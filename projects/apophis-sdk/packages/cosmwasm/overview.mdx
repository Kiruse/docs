The CosmWasm module serves primarily as a user-friendly and convenient wrapper for a set of
predefined messages, allowing developers to interact with smart contracts more efficiently. It
exposes a few methods to upload, deploy, and execute smart contracts, as well as the query methods
subgroup implementing the various low-level queries that CosmWasm supports.

## Example

```ts
import { Cosmos, LocalSigner, mw } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';
import { DefaultCosmWasmMiddlewares, CosmWasm } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmwasm';

mw.use(...DefaultCosmWasmMiddlewares);

const network = await Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet');
const signer = LocalSigner.fromMnemonic('...');

await Cosmos.ws(network).ready();

const response = await CosmWasm.query.smart({
  network,
  'neutron1...', // contract address
  // smart query messages are only JSON-formatted by convention, not by requirement
  // toBinary is a helper to serialize JSON messages
  // it's really just implemented using `TextEncoder`, `JSON`, and a marshaller
  CosmWasm.toBinary({
    config: {},
  }),
});
console.log(response);

await CosmWasm.execute(
  network,
  signer,
  'neutron1...', // contract address
  // same JSON convention here
  CosmWasm.toBinary({
    increment: {},
  }),
  [Cosmos.coin(1_000000n, 'untrn')], // optional native coin "funds" to pass along the call
);
```

## Outlook
There is still work to be done on the CosmWasm integration. Namely, further abstraction of smart
contracts and code generation for your smart contract messages, and
[AuthZ](https://docs.cosmos.network/v0.46/modules/authz/) messages.
