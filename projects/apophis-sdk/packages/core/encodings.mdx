title: "Encoding Subsystem"
description: "Apophis uses a fairly non-standard encoding subsystem, built on top of its middleware subsystem."
---

The `@apophis-sdk/core` package contains definitions for protobuf, and the `@apophis-sdk/cosmos`
package contains definitions for Amino, a Cosmos-specific encoding format. Cosmos messages generally
have to support both formats. To do so, the Messages concept was introduced. However, messages are
not a concrete class or interface. Instead, they hook into the encoding middleware.

Following is the definition of the Encoding Middleware:

```ts
export interface MiddlewareEncoding {
  encode(network: NetworkConfig, encoding: string, value: unknown): unknown;
  decode(network: NetworkConfig, encoding: string, value: unknown): unknown;
}
```

While it is more generic, it is typically only used to encode transaction payloads. As is often the
case, the exact implementation may differ from network to network. Any new encoding specification
may call this middleware with the following pattern:

```ts
import { mw, NetworkConfig } from '@apophis-sdk/core';
import type { MiddlewareImpl } from '@apophis-sdk/core/middleware.js';

// You don't have to use namespaces, but imo it works well for organizing messages
export namespace MyEncoding {
  export class MyType {
    constructor(public readonly value: string) {}
  }

  export function encode(network: NetworkConfig, value: MyType) {
    return mw('encoding', 'encode').inv().fifo(network, 'my-encoding', value);
  }
}

export const MyEncodingMiddleware: MiddlewareImpl = {
  encoding: {
    encode(network: NetworkConfig, encoding: string, value: unknown) {
      // e.g. this encoding is specific to Cosmos
      if (network.ecosystem !== 'cosmos' || encoding !== 'my-encoding') return;
      if (value instanceof MyEncoding.MyType) {
        return JSON.stringify({ myType: value.value });
      }
    },
    decode(network: NetworkConfig, encoding: string, value: any) {
      if (network.ecosystem !== 'cosmos' || encoding !== 'my-encoding') return;
      if (typeof value !== 'object' || !value || typeof value.myType !== 'string') return;
      return new MyEncoding.MyType(value.myType);
    },
  },
};

MyEncoding.encode({ ... }, new MyEncoding.MyType('foobar'));
```

Generally, to implement a new encoding, you will export a custom encoding middleware as the default
implementation. Anybody interested in overriding the encoding can do so selectively for a given
network. The most important part is that decoding restores the class of a value, especially if other
encodings for the same type exist.

## Implicit Interfaces
The default built-in ProtoBuf and Amino encodings used for the Cosmos integration use a concept of
*implicit interfaces* - i.e. types are made compatible without expressly implementing a TypeScript
interface. This is done because it is not the class instance that needs to adhere to a specific
interface, but the class itself, but the `implements` keyword gives no such assurance over the
actual class.

The ProtoBuf and Amino encodings use the `registerDefaultProtobuf` and `registerDefaultAmino`
methods respectively. The signature of these methods ensures a class is actually compatible. These
methods use the following definitions:

```ts @apophis-sdk/core/encoding/protobuf/any.ts
export type ProtobufType<T1 extends string = string, T2 = any> = {
  get protobufTypeUrl(): T1;
  toProtobuf(value: T2): Uint8Array;
  fromProtobuf(value: Uint8Array): T2;
};

export declare function registerDefaultProtobuf(...types: ProtobufType[]): void;
```

```ts @apophis-sdk/cosmos/encoding/amino.ts
export type AminoType<T1 extends string = string, T2 = any> = {
  get aminoTypeUrl(): T1;
  new(data: T2): { get data(); T2 }
};

export declare function registerDefaultAmino(...types: AminoType[]): void;
```

This allows establishing the connection between POJOs (the plain data objects after deserialization)
and their abstractions.

## Specialization: Public Keys
As Web3 is built fundamentally on asymmetric cryptography, public and private keys are a core concept
vital to all contemporary blockchains. However, just because two blockchains happen to use the
ed25519 or secp256k1 curves doesn't mean they use the same binary representation for transmission or
internal storage. Thus, the `@apophis-sdk/core` package only contains a rudimentary, generic
class with generalized public key types, and the `@apophis-sdk/cosmos` package implements their
encodings as follows:

```ts @apophis-sdk/core/crypto/pubkey.ts
import type { Bytes } from '@apophis-sdk/core/types.js';

export class PublicKey<T extends string = 'secp256k1' | 'ed25519'> {
  constructor(
    public readonly type: T,
    public readonly bytes: Bytes,
  ) {}
}

/** Interface defining `pubkey` functions. Augment to add new pubkey types. */
export interface Pubkeys {
  secp256k1(bytes: Bytes): PublicKey<'secp256k1'>;
  ed25519(bytes: Bytes): PublicKey<'ed25519'>;
}

export const pubkey: Pubkeys = {
  secp256k1: (bytes: Bytes) => new PublicKey('secp256k1', bytes),
  ed25519: (bytes: Bytes) => new PublicKey('ed25519', bytes),
}
```

```ts @apophis-sdk/cosmos/crypto/pubkey.ts
export const CosmosPubkeyMiddleware: MiddlewareImpl = {
  addresses: {
    compute(network: NetworkConfig, value: PublicKey) {
      if (network.ecosystem !== 'cosmos') return;
      if (value.type !== 'secp256k1') return;
      if (value.bytes.length !== 33)
        throw new Error('Invalid pubkey length, expected 33');
      const prefix = network.addressPrefix;
      return bech32.encode(prefix, bech32.toWords(ripemd160(sha256(value.bytes))));
    }
  },
  encoding: {
    encode(network: NetworkConfig, encoding: string, value: unknown) {
      if (network.ecosystem !== 'cosmos') return;
      if (value instanceof PublicKey) {
        return // ... encoded
      }
    },
    decode(network: NetworkConfig, encoding: string, value: unknown) {
      if (network.ecosystem !== 'cosmos') return;
      const type = // ... extract generalized type from Amino/protobuf
      const bytes = // ... extract pubkey bytes from Amino/protobuf
      return new PublicKey(type, bytes);
    },
  },
};
```

This bypasses the default ProtoBuf and Amino registries, but makes the types compatible with both
encodings nonetheless, without altering the `PublicKey` base class. Note that, of course, the
middleware has to be registered with `mw.use` (though it is included in `DefaultCosmosMiddlewares`).

As you can see, it also defines how these public keys are converted to addresses for specific
networks. A real use case for this is the Injective blockchain which uses a different elliptic
curve for its key pairs in order to be compatible with the EVM, and thus arrives at a different
address format.
