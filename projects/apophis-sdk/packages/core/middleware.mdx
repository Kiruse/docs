As an Apophis SDK consumer, you will likely only ever need to call `Apophis.use(...middlewares)` to
register the middlewares you are interested in:

```ts
import { Apophis } from '@apophis-sdk/core';
import { DefaultCosmosMiddlewares } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';
import { DefaultCosmWasmMiddlewares } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmwasm';

Apophis.use(...DefaultCosmosMiddlewares, ...DefaultCosmWasmMiddlewares);
```

Duplicate middlewares are de-duped by instance, so you can "nest" middlewares to bundle dependencies.
The `DefaultCosmWasmMiddlewares`, for example, depend on the `DefaultCosmosMiddlewares`, so you
really only need to register `...DefaultCosmosMiddlewares`, but it won't hurt to also register
`...DefaultCosmWasmMiddlewares`.

## Implementing Middleware
Middlewares are arbitrary multi-level objects that are registered in a global array and executed by
some strategy defined at the callsite. If a middleware does not implement a method, it is
automatically skipped. The following examples are valid middlewares:

```ts
import { type MiddlewareImpl } from '@apophis-sdk/core/middleware.js';

const MyMiddleware1 = {
  addresses: {
    alias(address: string): string {
      return address;
    },
  },
} satisfies MiddlewareImpl;

const MyMiddleware2: MiddlewareImpl = {
  addresses: {
    resolve(address: string): string {
      return address;
    },
  },
  encoding: {
    encode(network: NetworkConfig, encoding: string, value: unknown) {
      if (network.ecosystem !== 'cosmos') return;
      if (encoding !== 'json') return;
      return JSON.stringify(value);
    },
  },
};

const MyMiddleware3 = {} satisfies MiddlewareImpl;
```

## Pipelines
Callsites of middlewares must specify the strategy by which to execute the middleware stack. There
are various strategies implemented by the internal MiddlewarePipeline class, which adheres to the
following interface:

```ts
interface MiddlewarePipeline<KP extends string[]> {
  /** Helper to invert the pipeline execution order */
  inv(): MiddlewarePipeline<KP>;

  /** Send a single value through the entire pipeline, transforming it along
   * the way.
   *
   * If a middleware returns `undefined` it is simply skipped and the value
   * remains unchanged in this round.
   */
  transform(arg: TransformType<KP>): TransformType<KP>;

  /** Call every middleware endpoint in order, passing in the given arguments.
   * The first middleware that returns any value other than `undefined` wins
   * and its result returned to the callsite.
   *
   * If no middleware returns a value, throws a MiddlewarePipelineError.
   */
  fifo(...args: FifoArgs<KP>): Defined<FifoResult<KP>>;

  /** Like `fifo` but returns `undefined` rather than throwing an error. */
  fifoMaybe(...args: FifoArgs<KP>): Defined<FifoResult<KP>> | undefined;

  /** Like `fifo` but async. Awaits every middleware in order and can thus be slow. */
  fifoAsync(...args: FifoArgs<KP>): Promise<Awaited<Defined<FifoResult<KP>>>>;

  /** Like `fifoAsync` but returns `undefined` rather than throwing an error. */
  fifoAsyncMaybe(...args: FifoArgs<KP>): Promise<Awaited<Defined<FifoResult<KP>>> | undefined>;

  /** A way for callsites to notify middlewares of some occurrence.
   * The notification handlers may be async. All errors and rejections will
   * be caught and logged with `console.error`.
   */
  notify(...args: NotifyArgs<KP>): Promise<void>;

  /** Like `notify` but the handlers cannot be async. */
  notifySync(...args: NotifyArgs<KP>): void;

  /** A reducer to iterate over and invoke all middlewares in order,
   * aggregating their result by some arbitrary logic.
   *
   * Admittedly, typing this reducer is tough and needs more work.
   */
  reduce(args: any[], reducer: (result: any, response: any) => any, initial: any): any;
}
```

`KP` is the key path to the middleware and serves to extract the correct function signature.
Following is an example of how to use the `mw` function which produces such a `MiddlewarePipeline`:

```ts
import { mw } from '@apophis-sdk/core';

const addr = mw('addresses', 'compute').inv().fifo(network, pubkey);
```

## Middleware Stack
The mw method exposes some additional properties. One of these properties is mw.stack which is an
array of all registered middlewares. If necessary, you can inspect or even alter the stack:

```ts
import { mw } from '@apophis-sdk/core/middleware.js';
import { MemoryAddressBook } from '@apophis-sdk/core/address.js';

// Insert a middleware before `MemoryAddressBook` or append to the end if not found
let idx = mw.stack.findIndex(m => m instanceof MemoryAddressBook);
if (idx !== -1) {
  mw.stack.splice(idx, 0, MyMiddleware);
} else {
  mw.stack.push(MyMiddleware);
}
```
