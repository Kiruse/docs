title: "Core Overview"
description: "Contains the most generic definitions common to most blockchain ecosystems I've worked with. However, by itself, it is probably mostly uninteresting to you."

The core package is concerned with standardizing aspects of web3 development across ecosystems. It
contains such things as:

- `NetworkConfig`
- Various `signals`
- Generalized `pubkey` factory and `PublicKey` type
- [Middleware](/projects/apophis-sdk/middleware) `mv` subsystem
- Generalized type interfaces, such as `TxBase` and `Signer<Tx extends TxBase>`
- [protobuf](https://protobuf.dev/) support (WIP)
- Shared business logic with deferrals to middlewares for ecosystem-specific implementations

## Network Configs
Among the most important concepts in the SDK are `NetworkConfig`s. These are used to configure the
SDK for a specific blockchain, including which RPC to use. Most of the SDK is built on
`NetworkConfig`s. Importantly, each `NetworkConfig` is referenced by instance. If your custom systems
require generalization or persistence, it should generally refer to the network's `name` or
`chainId` instead.

While both are unique identifiers for a chain, the `name` refers to the current canonical name of
the chain, while `chainId` uniquely identifies a specific hard fork of a chain. For example,
"cosmoshub" refers to the latest version of the Cosmos Hub as agreed upon by its active validator
set, while "cosmoshub-4" refers to a specific version of the Hub. But generally, you are likely fine
just using `name` for most purposes.

## Signals
Signals are technically an optional feature of the SDK, but a highly useful one. They act as a sort
of lightweight dependency injection system, allowing you to inject certain frequently-used values
into the application, and making it easier to manage through a GUI (e.g. a Wallet Modal).

The `signals` object contains the following signals:

- `signer` (*signal*) for the currently connected signer,
- `network` (*signal*) for the currently connected network,
- `chainId` (*computed*) for the chain ID of the currently connected network,
- `publicKey` (*computed*) for the public key of the currently connected address,
- `address` (*computed*) for the currently connected address,
- `bech32prefix` (*computed*) for the Bech32 prefix of the currently connected network, if applicable.

## Public Keys
Every blockchain is based on the cryptographic primitive of key pairs, even if abstracted away behind
social logins or multi-sig wallets. However, their representation may differ from chain to chain.
The `pubkey` wraps the different types of public keys, but has otherwise no knowledge of how to
serialize or encode them; this is provided by other packages like `@apophis/cosmos` through the
middleware system.

As a consumer of the SDK, you will likely only need the `pubkey` factory.
