title: "Apophis SDK - Cosmos REST API"
description: "Apophis provides a REST API abstraction for Cosmos RPCs."

The `Cosmos` object exposes a `rest(network)` method that allows you to call RPC methods exposed
through HTTPS. RPC endpoints are mapped directly to the REST API object structure:

```ts
import { Cosmos } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';

const network = await Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet');

const { balances, pagination } = await Cosmos.rest(network).bank.v1beta1.balances['neutron1...']('GET');
console.log(balances);
```

## Virtual Typing
The REST API is built on top of my [@kiruse/restful](https://github.com/kiruse/restful.ts) library
which leverages a "virtual typing" system. This means that even if an endpoint is not defined in
the Apophis SDK, you can still call it using the same pattern as above. Simply refer to your chain's
OpenAPI specification and pass in the appropriate parameters.

```ts
import { Cosmos } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';

const network = await Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet');

const api = await Cosmos.rest(network) as any;

// I genuinely have no idea if this endpoint exists, but it demonstrates the point
const { items, pagination } = await api.authz.v1beta1['neutron1...'].grants('GET');
console.log(items);
```
