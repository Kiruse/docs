Currently the only blockchain integration for the Cosmos ecosystem. Its most important export is the
`Cosmos` object:

```ts
import {
  Apophis,
  Bank,
  Cosmos,
  DefaultCosmosMiddlewares,
  LocalSigner,
} from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';
Apophis.use(...DefaultCosmosMiddlewares);

// Get a `CosmosNetworkConfig` for the Neutron Testnet from the
// Cosmos Chain Registry: https://github.com/cosmos/chain-registry
const network = await Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet');

// For testing or tooling only! Strongly discouraged in a production Dapp!
// See https://github.com/kiruse/cosmos-components for a Dapp solution.
const signer = LocalSigner.fromMnemonic('...');

// Wait for WebSockets to be ready (if you plan to use them).
await Cosmos.ws(network).ready();

// Get the current block
const { block } = await Cosmos.ws(network).getBlock();
console.log(block.header.hash, block.header.height, block.header.timestamp);
// Types are deserialized: block.header.height is a bigint, and
// block.header.timestamp is a Date

// Tx factory, takes arbitrary messages in
// Note that only a small subset of messages are currently implemented
const tx = Cosmos.tx([
  new Bank.Send({
    fromAddress: signer.address(network),
    toAddress: signer.address(network),
    amount: [Cosmos.coin(1_000000n, 'untrn')],
  }),
]);

// `true` here automatically populates the tx's internal gas fee field
await tx.estimateGas(network, signer, true);

// upon signing, the tx becomes bound to the given network
await signer.sign(network, tx);

// broadcasting returns immediately and does not wait for confirmation
await tx.broadcast();

// but it waits for admission - i.e. the tx is valid, but not yet finalized
if (tx.status === 'success') {
  // You can wait for finalization like this:
  const result = await Cosmos.ws(network).expectTx(tx);
  console.log(result);
}

// no matter what, even if the tx hasn't been broadcasted yet, you can get its hash:
console.log(tx.hash);
```

Although not a hard requirement, when developing Dapps, it is useful to use the `signals` from the
`core` library:

```ts
import { signals } from '@apophis-sdk/core';

signals.network.subscribe(network => {
  console.log('Switched to network:', network);
});

signals.address.subscribe(address => {
  console.log('Active address:', address);
});
```

Using these `signals` makes it trivial to create integrations for specific frontend frameworks
without having to worry about frontend-specific usage. These signals can even be used without any
frontend framework at all, enabling you to use the same Apophis SDK for both frontend and backend
development.
