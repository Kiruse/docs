description: "Apophis provides a WebSocket API abstraction for Cosmos RPCs."

The `Cosmos` object also exposes a `ws(network)` method that allows you to interact with the
WebSocket API of a full node. Some WebSocket endpoints have overlap with the REST API, but others
are unique to the WebSocket API. Most importantly, it abstracts block and transaction subscriptions
through the `.onBlock` and `.onTx` methods.

**Beware** that most public nodes enforce a strict rate limit of 5 subscriptions per client. If you
require more, you will need to run your own isolated full node. However, typically, 5 subscriptions
is enough for most Dapps.

```ts
import { Cosmos, TendermintQuery } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';

const network = await Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet');

const ws = Cosmos.ws(network);
ws.onBlock(block => {
  console.log('New block:', block.header.height);
});

let query = new TendermintQuery().exact('tx.hash', '<my-hash>');

ws.onTx(query, tx => {
  console.log('Tx confirmed:', tx.hash);
});
```

It also exposes an `expectTx` method which you can use to await the confirmation of a transaction:

```ts
const tx = Cosmos.tx([/* ... */]);

const result = await ws.expectTx(tx);
console.log(result);
```

## Tendermint Queries
Tendermint is underlying the Cosmos SDK and provides a way for full nodes to index and query
transactions based on events and their attributes emitted by the Cosmos SDK modules and smart
contracts.

The `TendermintQuery` class is a builder for Tendermint queries. It provides a fluent interface for
building queries and is a first-class citizen in Apophis' WebSocket API.

```ts
const address = 'neutron1...';
const query = new TendermintQuery().exact('message.sender', address);

ws.onTx(query, tx => {
  console.log(`Tx sent by ${address}:`, tx.hash);
});
```

There are some built-in query keys:

- `block.height`
- `message.sender`
- **TODO: List built-in query keys**

But you can also query by attributes emitted on the `Response` of your smart contract:

**TODO: Example**

myself. :)*
