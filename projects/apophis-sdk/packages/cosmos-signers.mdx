The `@apophis-sdk/cosmos-signers` package is a bundle of signers for the Cosmos ecosystem. It
includes the following signers:

- `KeplrSigner` & `LeapSigner` from the [@apophis-sdk/keplr-signer](https://docs.kiruse.dev/projects/apophis-sdk/packages/keplr-signer) package
- `WalletConnectCosmosSigner` from the [@apophis-sdk/walletconnect-signer](https://docs.kiruse.dev/projects/apophis-sdk/packages/walletconnect-signer) package

Other signers will be added in the future. Particularly, I'm eyeing:

- Direct [Ledger](https://ledger.com) support (i.e. no wallet like Keplr needed)
- Direct [Keystone](https://keyst.one) support
- Rujira Station (formerly [Station](https://station.money)), once it's been released
- [Vultisig](https://vultisig.com)
- [CosmIFrame](https://github.com/DA0-DA0/cosmiframe) (DAODAO support)

**Example:**

```ts
import { registerCosmosSigners } from "@apophis-sdk/cosmos-signers";

const WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID = '...';

registerCosmosSigners(WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID);
```

Of course, you can also manually register only the signers you need:

```ts
import { KeplrSigner, LeapSigner, WalletConnectCosmosSigner } from "@apophis-sdk/cosmos-signers";
Signer.register(
  new KeplrSigner(),
  new LeapSigner(),
  new WalletConnectCosmosSigner({ projectId: WALLETCONNECT_PROJECT_ID }),
);
```

## Using Signers
The core library exposes the `signals` object which in turn exposes the `signer` signal. Throughout
the SDK, this signal is often used as fallback when not providing a specific signer. Similarly, the
[Cosmos Components](/projects/cosmos-components) populate this signal when a signer is connected
through the Wallet Modal.

The below example shows how to use the `signer` to sign and broadcast a transaction within Preact:

```ts
import { signals } from "@apophis-sdk/core";
import { Cosmos } from "@apophis-sdk/cosmos";
import { useMemo } from "preact/hooks";
import { useComputed } from "@preact/signals";

function MyComponent() {
  const msgs = useComputed(() => [
    new Bank.Send({
      fromAddress: signals.address.value,
      toAddress: 'neutron1...', // e.g. your developer address
      amount: [Cosmos.coin(1_000000n, 'untrn')],
    }),
  ]);

  const tx = useMemo(() => Cosmos.signalTx(msgs), [msgs]);

  return (
    <button onClick={() => {
      const txHash = await tx.signAndBroadcast(); // uses `signals.signer` internally when not specified above during `signalTx` call
      console.log(txHash);
    }}>Send Payment</button>
  );
}
```
