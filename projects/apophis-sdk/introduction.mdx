description: "What is the Apophis SDK?"
---

Apophis is a Web3 SDK designed for the blockchain omniverse. Originally built for the Cosmos
ecosystem, I've refactored it to generalize to more ecosystems, particularly EVM & SVM - although
each ecosystem will have its own specializations.

Apophis is designed to be easy to get into and to accelerate your development process. Its objective
is to accomplish much with as little code as possible.

## Etymology

Apophis is the [Egyptian serpent deity](https://www.worldhistory.org/Apophis/) of darkness, chaos,
and destruction. [99942 Apophis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/99942_Apophis) is also an asteroid
that appeared out of nowhere in the early 2000s and threatened to destroy all that exists (which has
since been ruled out, don't worry). Many projects in the Cosmos ecosystem are named after celestial
bodies, and this SDK is no exception. I've chosen Apophis, the asteroid that showed up out of nowhere,
as the namesake of this project, as it aims to dominate the chaos left by its progenitor.

## Packages
In order to support the plethora of contemporary & vastly diverse blockchains, the SDK must be
hyper-modular. It consists of multiple packages of different levels of abstraction:

- `core` - Common generalizations for the omniverse of blockchains. Constains things like types,
  utilities, the middleware subsystem, common encodings, and signals.
- `cosmos` - A specialization of the Apophis SDK for the Cosmos ecosystem.
- `cosmwasm` - An extension of the `cosmos` package, adding support for CosmWasm.
- `cosmos-signers` - A bundle package of signers for the Cosmos ecosystem. Currently only contains
  the `keplr-signer` (which includes support for [Keplr](https://keplr.app/) &
  [Leap](https://leapwallet.io/)) and `walletconnect-signer` packages.

To install the SDK, use your favorite package manager's equivalent of:

```bash
npm install @apophis-sdk/core @apophis-sdk/cosmos @apophis-sdk/cosmwasm @apophis-sdk/cosmos-signers
```

All packages are published in bulk and are locked to the same version, such that `@apophis-sdk/cosmos`
has a peer-dependency on `@apophis-sdk/core` of the same version.

## Quickstart
Following is a simple example you might use to build a simple CLI tool to send a transaction on the
Neutron testnet to yourself.

```ts
import { Apophis, Cosmos, DefaultCosmosMiddlewares, LocalSigner } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';

Apophis.use(...DefaultCosmosMiddlewares);

const mnemonic = '...';

const signer = LocalSigner.fromMnemonic(mnemonic);
const network = await Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet');

const tx = Cosmos.tx([
  new Bank.Send({
    fromAddress: signer.address,
    toAddress: signer.address,
    amount: [Cosmos.coin(1n, 'untrn')],
  }),
]);

await tx.estimateGas(network, signer, true); // true stores the gas price in the tx object
await signer.sign(network, tx);
const result = await tx.broadcast(network);

// success does not indicate that the tx was actually successful, only that it hasn't been rejected
// prior to execution, e.g. if the user has insufficient funds to cover gas.
if (result.success) {
  try {
    await Cosmos.ws(network).expectTx(tx);
    console.log('tx successful:', tx.hash);
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('tx failed:', error);
  }
}
```

## Web Components
I've built another package for the development of Web3 Dapps called
[`@kiruse/cosmos-components`](https://docs.kiruse.dev/projects/cosmos-components). It is complementary
to the Apophis SDK following the same philosophy of DX-first:

```tsx
import { signals } from '@apophis-sdk/core';
import { Apophis, Cosmos, DefaultCosmosMiddlewares } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';
import { CosmosComponents, reconnectSigner } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';
import { render } from 'preact';

Apophis.use(...DefaultCosmosMiddlewares);

// though you may want to hard-code these to remove the async overhead
const networks = Promise.all([
  Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutron'),
  Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet'),
  Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('cosmoshub'),
  Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('osmosis'),
  Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('terra2'),
]);

// Register all components
CosmosComponents.register();

networks.then((networks) => {
  reconnectSigner(networks);
});

render(<MyApp />, document.body);

function MyApp() {
  return (
    <cosmos-connect-boundary>
      <div slot="content">
        Welcome, <cosmos-user-address />!
      </div>
      <div slot="connect">
        <button
          onClick={async () => modals.showWalletModal(await networks)}
        >Connect Wallet</button>
      </div>
    </cosmos-connect-boundary>
  );
}
```
