Modals are the least intrusive way to provide a default user experience on top of your own application.
Frankly, I am not quite sure how to best design them to integrate nicely with your own modals and
am open to suggestions.

## Spawning Modals
Modals are spawned with the `modals` object's methods:

```ts
import { Apophis, Cosmos, DefaultCosmosMiddlewares } from '@apophis-sdk/cosmos';
import { modals } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

Apophis.use(...DefaultCosmosMiddlewares);

const networks = Promise.all([
  Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutron'),
  Cosmos.getNetworkFromRegistry('neutrontestnet'),
]);

// Error Modal takes in `any`
modals.showErrorModal('An error occurred');

networks.then(networks => modals.showWalletModal(networks));
```

Unlike other components, there are two ways to replace modals:

- Replace the `cosmos-modal-base` component with your own custom element, or
- Replace the properties of the `modals` object.

## Replacing the `cosmos-modal-base` component

Currently, the best way to create a uniform modal design is to replace the `cosmos-modal-base`
component with your own custom element.

```ts
import { CosmosComponents } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

class MyModal extends HTMLElement {
  // ... define your custom element
}

CosmosComponents.default()
  .with('cosmos-modal-base', MyModal)
  .register();
```

Alternatively, of course, you could simply build your own modals on top of `cosmos-modal-base`
and customize them to your liking.

There are currently 2 modals in the library:

- `cosmos-modal-wallet` - A modal for selecting & connecting a wallet.
- `cosmos-modal-error` - A modal for displaying an error to the user.

## Custom Error Formatters
The Error Modal takes in any argument, and iterates over its formatters to attempt to stringify the
error. If it succeeds, it displays the formatted error. Otherwise, it JSON-stringifies the error and
displays that. It comes with a few built-in formatters for common errors such as "Out of Gas",
"Insufficient Funds", `Error` instances, etc.

You can also define your own formatters:

```ts
import { formatError } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

formatError.addFormatter(error => {
  if (error instanceof Error && error.message.includes('insufficient funds')) {
    return 'Insufficient funds';
  }
});
```

If your custom formatter returns `undefined`, it will be ignored. If no formatter returns a value,
the modal will display the JSON-stringified error.

The expected return value is either a string or an `HTMLElement`. You can use a frontend framework
like React, Preact, or Vue to render your error message, however, you will need to render it into
an `HTMLElement` and handle cleanup when the modal is `remove`d. Refer to
[Creating Custom Elements](/projects/cosmos-components/creating-custom-elements) for more information.

## Replacing the `modals` methods
Rather than exporting the Modals methods directly, exporting them under a `modals` object allows you
to replace the methods with your own custom ones. This allows you to integrate the Cosmos Components
with your own frontend framework.

Unlike Toasts, Modals are more specialized for specific use cases & data:

```tsx modals-shim.ts
import { type NetworkConfig } from '@apophis-sdk/core';
import { modals } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

modals.showErrorModal = (error: any) => myModalFactory.showErrorModal(error);
modals.showWalletModal = (networks: NetworkConfig[]) => myModalFactory.showWalletModal(networks);
```

This will allow the Cosmos Components to use your own toast system.
