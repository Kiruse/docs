Cosmos Components can be customized in 3 main ways, with different levels of control and complexity:

- Changing the default styles of the root and part components,
- Using design tokens (CSS variables aka. custom properties) to change colors, fonts, and other properties,
- Replacing them entirely with your own custom elements.

All aspects of components are documented in the [Storybook](https://cosmos-components.kiruse.dev).

## Changing the default styles
As you would with any other HTML element, you can simply add your own styles to the root and part
components. For example, you can make balances more uniform:

```css
cosmos-balance {
  background-color: #f0f0f0;
  padding: 0.5rem;
  border-radius: 0.25rem;
}

cosmos-balance::part(value) {
  font-family: monospace;
  width: 4rem;
  text-align: right;
}

cosmos-balance::part(denom) {
  text-transform: uppercase;
}
```

## Using design tokens
All design tokens are documented in the [Storybook](https://cosmos-components.kiruse.dev). All
design tokens have default values, but you can override them as needed:

```css
:root {
  --cosmos-spacing: 10px;
  --cosmos-roundness: 6px;
  --cosmos-primary-color-500:rgb(247, 156, 65);
}
```

Specifying them on `:root` sets them for your entire application, but they can also be set on
every single CSS selector you can come up with.

## Replacing components
Once a custom element has been registered, there is no way to unregister or override it. Thus,
the `CosmosComponents` class lets you decide which components you wish to use and which you wish to
replace with your own.

```ts
import { CosmosComponents } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

class MyWalletModal extends HTMLElement {
  // ... define your custom element
}

CosmosComponents.default()
  .with('cosmos-modal-wallet', MyWalletModal)
  .register();
```

However, your custom element will need to support the same attributes/properties as the original, as
some of them are used internally by the library itself (e.g. `cosmos-user-address` builds upon
`cosmos-address`).

All attributes are documented in the [Storybook](https://cosmos-components.kiruse.dev).
