As web components, the Cosmos Components are directly usable in both HTML and JSX. However, For
TypeScript projects, you will need to import the JSX bindings for your frontend framework of choice,
or integrate them manually. Bindings currently exist for Preact and React.

```ts
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/preact.js';
// or
import '@kiruse/cosmos-components/react.js';
```

## Manual Integration
The Cosmos Components export a convenient type `CosmosElements` which you can use to extend the
`IntrinsicElements` interface of your frontend framework. Following is an example of how I've
integrated them with Preact:

```ts
import type { CosmosElements } from '@kiruse/cosmos-components';

declare module 'preact/jsx-runtime' {
  namespace JSX {
    interface IntrinsicElements extends CosmosElements {}
  }
}
```

Place this anywhere in your project and import where needed, or use as ambient module (requires
changes to `tsconfig.json`).

TypeScript accepts a configuration option `jsxImportSource` which often needs to be defined for
a non-React project. Whatever value you set here is the module you need to augment in the snippet
above, plus the `/jsx-runtime` path.
